## Data Setup and Running the Code

1. **Download the data**

   All required datasets can be obtained from the USGS ScienceBase repository:  
   👉 [https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6206d3c2d34ec05caca53071](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6206d3c2d34ec05caca53071)

2. **Organize the data files**

   After downloading, organize the files within the `data/` directory as follows:

   data/
   ├── GCM/                 # Climate projection files
   ├── meteo_csv_files/     # NLDAS weather files

   Any remaining data files may be placed in the `data/` directory.
